                    <h2>Not Weird. Queer Version History</h2>
                    <p><em>Not Weird. Queer</em> is a loosely autobiographical text-based video game about a trans teen going through middle school.</p> 
                    <p>Currently, <em>Not Weird. Queer</em> is still in the alpha-af (pre-alpha) stage of developement.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="project">
                    <h2>Alpha-af</h2>
                    <p>Alpha-af versions are work-in-progresses. They do not include the full story and contain dummy dialogue and skeleton pages.  Point systems are subject to change without notice.</p>

                    <h3>Version 0.0.004</h3>
                    <p>Version <a href="twine/Not-Weird-Queer-0.0.004.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.0.004</a> includes an improved part 1 loop and the start of the part 2 loop.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Known issue</strong>: when choosing a name, the Harlowe engine will occasionally display an error message. If you click "OK" on the message, the game will resume normally.</li>
                        <li>Now more variety for the ally's name (randomized), player character's deadname (randomized), and player character's default name suggester.</li>
                        <li>Slight part 1 point-based action balance tweaks and changes to dummy text and skeleton pages. </li>
                        <li>v. 0.0.003 bug fixes:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fixed the bug where every 4th day after day 3 (day 7, day 11, etc.), if you choose to talk to the ally during PE after defending your gender, you will skip lunch that day.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>Known bug</strong>: if you input a name that is already the ally's name or your deadname, the Harlowe engine will run into an error.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Version 0.0.003</h3>
                    <p>Version <a href="twine/Not Weird. Queer 0-0-003.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.0.003</a> includes a fully playable part 1 loop.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Completely overhauled the story loop.</li>
                        <li>Reworked the point-based action balances for hidden variables:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each applicable action only increases or decreases happiness by one point at most.</li>
                            <li>No actions affect self-esteem points - these are calculated at the end of each day and are cumulative.</li>
                            <li>Added ally points that affect the progress of part 1 at certain thresholds.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Changed the ally's name from Ryan to a dynamic variable based on the gender of the player character.</li>
                        <li>Smoothed some skeleton text.</li>
                        <li>Known bug: every 4th day after day 3 (day 7, day 11, etc.), if you choose to talk to the ally during PE after defending your gender, you will skip lunch that day.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Known bug: If Ryan doesn't save the player during lunch, storming out of the cafeteria leads to a page with a broken <em>else</em> statement.</li>
                    </ul>
