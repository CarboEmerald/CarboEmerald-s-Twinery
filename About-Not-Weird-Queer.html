                <h2>Not Weird. Queer</h2>
                <p><em>Not Weird. Queer</em> is a loosely autobiographical text-based video game about a trans teen going through middle school.</p> 
                <p>Currently, <em>Not Weird. Queer</em> is still in the alpha-af (pre-alpha) stage of developement.</p>
                <p>Eventually, if I'm still interested, I might make <em>Not Weird. Queer</em> into a proper visual novel complete with art assests.  As I'm not a proper artist myself, the likelyhood of this happening is small, but nonzero.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Known bug: If Ryan doesn't save the player during lunch, storming out of the cafeteria leads to a page with a broken <em>else</em> statement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Version <a href="Not Weird. Queer 0-0-003.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.0.003</a> includes a fully playable Part 1 loop.</li>

                            <li>Each applicable action only increases or decreases happiness by one point at most.</li>
                            <li>No actions affect self-esteem points - these are calculated at the end of each day and are cumulative.</li>
                            <li>Added ally points that affect the progress of part 1 at certain thresholds.</li>
