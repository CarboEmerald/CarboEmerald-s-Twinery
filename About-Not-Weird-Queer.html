                <h2>Not Weird. Queer</h2>
                <p><em>Not Weird. Queer</em> is a loosely autobiographical text-based video game about a trans teen going through middle school.</p> 
                <p>Currently, <em>Not Weird. Queer</em> is still in the alpha-af (pre-alpha) stage of developement.</p>
                <p>Eventually, if I'm still interested, I might make <em>Not Weird. Queer</em> into a proper visual novel complete with art assests.  As I'm not a proper artist myself, the likelyhood of this happening is small, but nonzero.</p>
